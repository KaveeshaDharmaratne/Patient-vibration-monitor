# Patient Vibration Monitor

## Overview
A real-time vibration monitoring system for patients using ESP32-S3 Nano, MPU6050 sensor, and Edge Impulse machine learning for pattern recognition. The system detects critical vibration patterns (such as seizures) and triggers appropriate alerts through multiple channels.

## Hardware Components
- **ESP32-S3 Nano**: Main microcontroller with WiFi and Bluetooth
- **MPU6050**: 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscope sensor
- **Buzzer**: Audio alert system
- **Status LEDs**: Visual indicators (RGB or multiple single-color LEDs)
- **Optional**: External speaker for enhanced audio alerts

## Features
- Real-time vibration pattern detection using Edge Impulse ML models
- Multi-modal alerts (audio, visual, remote)
- MQTT communication for remote monitoring
- WiFi connectivity with secure communication
- Sensor calibration and data logging
- Over-the-air configuration updates
